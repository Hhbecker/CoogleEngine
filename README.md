Hashmap vs Hashtable
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-hashmap-and-hashtable-in-java/

How I'll handle collisions: chaining

Key = word+documentID asccii sum
Value = number of occurences of the word in that document

This hashmap will free memory automatically when nodes are removed to prevent memory leaks and maintain performance over time.


To Do 
* answer question at bottom of specs
* ask how to run it on seas shell
* improve lucid chart memory diagram

* in put method: efficiency gain by adding new node to front instead of back? 

* transfer testing print statement from hashmap.c into assert statements in test.c

* man pages
* GDB
* valgrind
* make file
* assert statements to test
* comment in info on each line of makefile 
* for each function for each parameter null check it 
* use Strcmp = string compare 
* write in some assembly directly into C to make it faster 

* make a demo folder so people can clone the repo and search amongst given files (maybe integrate a java or python GUI)

Questions
* how would I go about integrating a Java or Python GUI with this C code?
* what is the point of the #define HASHMAP_H command at the top of the header file? It's a compiler thing - find out more 

Why would the number of occurences passed into hm_put ever be more than one?
the number of occurences passed into put is determined by calling get and incrementing the number of occurences returned

Is chaining the linked list in a buckett design choice or is it overwriting num occurences 

Each value is assigned a key
The key is input into a hashing function which places the key in a bucket out of N buckets
The key value pair is then added to the end of the linked list at that bucket

A collision, or more specifically, a hash code collision in a HashMap, isÂ a situation where two or more key objects produce the same final hash value and hence point to the same bucket location or array index.

Questions
-what is the point of the #define HASHMAP_H command at the top of the header file? It's a compiler thing - find out more 

Each value is assigned a key
The key is input into a hashing function which places the key in a bucket out of N buckets
The key value pair is then added to the end of the linked list at that bucket

A collision, or more specifically, a hash code collision in a HashMap, isÂ a situation where two or more key objects produce the same final hash value and hence point to the same bucket location or array index.
